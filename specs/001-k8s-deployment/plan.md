# Implementation Plan: Deploy Todo Chatbot on Kubernetes with AI-assisted DevOps tools

**Branch**: `001-k8s-deployment` | **Date**: 2026-01-28 | **Spec**: [link to spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-k8s-deployment/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the deployment of the Todo Chatbot application (frontend React/Next.js + backend Python FastAPI) on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. The approach leverages AI-assisted DevOps tools (Gordon, kubectl-ai, Kagent) to containerize, orchestrate, and manage the application lifecycle. The deployment will utilize Docker for containerization, Helm Charts for package management, and establish a local development environment that mirrors production deployment patterns.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 (Backend), JavaScript/TypeScript (Frontend)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docker, Minikube, Helm, kubectl, Gordon (AI Docker Assistant), kubectl-ai, Kagent
**Storage**: SQLite/JSON (for local development)
**Testing**: Kubernetes manifests validation, Helm linting, deployment verification
**Target Platform**: Local Kubernetes cluster (Minikube)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend microservices)
**Performance Goals**: Efficient resource utilization on local development environment
**Constraints**: Resource limitations of local Minikube cluster, local development focus
**Scale/Scope**: Single application deployment with frontend, backend, and optional database services

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Gate 1: Container-First Architecture Compliance
✅ PASS - All services (frontend React/Next.js, backend Python FastAPI) will be containerized using Docker as required by principle I.

### Gate 2: Infrastructure as Code Compliance
✅ PASS - All Kubernetes resources will be defined declaratively using YAML manifests and Helm charts as required by principle II.

### Gate 3: AI-Assisted Operations Compliance
✅ PASS - Deployment will leverage AI tools (Gordon, kubectl-ai, Kagent) for generating, managing, and troubleshooting Kubernetes deployments as required by principle III.

### Gate 4: Local-First Development Compliance
✅ PASS - Deployment targets local Kubernetes environment (Minikube) for development and testing as required by principle IV.

### Gate 5: Observability and Monitoring Compliance
✅ PASS - Plan includes provisions for implementing logging, monitoring, and alerting for deployed services as required by principle V.

### Gate 6: Declarative Configuration Management Compliance
✅ PASS - All application configurations will be managed through Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets as required by principle VI.
